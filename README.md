[manual](https://github.com/fgRuslan/easyAnim/blob/master/manual.md)

## How to install the library
You should clone this from github  by  this  command:

```
git clone https://github.com/fgRuslan/easyAnim.git
```

Or  from  npm:

```
npm install easyanim
```

Or  you  can  download  an  archive.

## How  to  use  the  library
You  should  write  this  code  to  load  jQuery  and  jQueryUI,which  are  used  by  easyanim.

```html
<link href="jquery-ui.css" 
rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
<script src="easy.js"></script>
<script src="jQuery.js"></script>
<script src="jQueryUI.js"></script>
```
When  you  finished  this  step  you   can  use  the  library.

Note  that  you  can  use  minimify.py  to  minimify  easy.js  by  removing  CRLFs  in  the  file.

```
python minimify.py
```

Beware!You  shouldn't  use  comments  like  this  -  //,only  /*  */

Minimify  won't  work  then.
